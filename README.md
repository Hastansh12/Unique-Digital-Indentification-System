# Unique-Digital-Indentification-System
This Project was made for a 24 hour Hackathon in our college.
Problem statement for the domain of AIML was to develop a collaborative approach to
classify different proofs, images and documents into multiple predefined categories using
a ML model and create a digital identity of a citizen. Furthermore, develop a process to
create a biometrics system
